    <h1>Let's take a look at my projects</h1>

  <p>During my times as a Public Relations intern at <a href="https://rosepr.ca/fr/" target="_blank">Rose PR</a>, 
    I get to work on many interesting projects that I want to share. These experiences not only enriched my skill set but 
    also provided me with valuable insights into the world of public relations.

<p>This was my first PR event ever, and I learned an incredible amount throughout the process. Situated in the heart of Chinatown, Montreal, 
  <a href="https://www.terrassecarla.com/" target="_blank">Terrasse Carla</a> is renowned for its unique fusion of French bistro cuisine with vibrant Vietnamese flavors. 
  From creating the hit list to managing the RSVPs and orchestrating table seating, every task contributed 
  to my growth and understanding of event coordination. Overall, this event was a transformative learning opportunity 
  that solidified my passion for PR.</p>

<h3 class="custom-list">Boa Vida Summer Opening Event</h3>

<p>This was a fun one, because <a href="https://boavidayachtclub.com/fr/" target="_blank">Boa Vida</a> is an outdoor yacht club in Montreal. 
  The venue itself exuded elegance and sophistication, providing the perfect backdrop for a memorable summer soirée. Admittedly, the only minor drawback is that I had to stand 
  for four hours straight to do check-ins, but it was definitely worth it. I had the opportunity to encounter many famous celebrities 
  and influential figures, adding an extra layer of excitement to the event. Interacting with such prominent guests allowed me to hone my 
  communication and interpersonal skills, and it was truly inspiring to witness their genuine appreciation for the festivities. </p>

  <h3 class="custom-list">Honeyrose Media Tasting Event</h3>

  <p>In contrast to the grandeur of Boa Vida, this event is an intimate affair meticulously curated for esteemed journalists. This smaller scale 
    enables a deeper level of engagement and provides a platform for meaningful conversations about the offerings. As an intern, 
    this occassion provided me with a unique opportunity to witness the impact of targeted media relations in action. 
    I had the chance to assist in crafting tailored pitches and observing firsthand how strategic communication can influence media coverage. 
    It was a valuable learning experience that highlighted the importance of precision and personalization in public relations efforts.</p>
