<p>Top 3 Things I'm Totally Into Right Now</p>
<ol>
<li class="list-bio"> <strong>Coding</strong>: So, guess who's been hitting the coding books lately? Yep, yours truly!  This newfound skill has opened up a 
  realm of possibilities for me, allowing me to enhance the digital aspects of my work. I also recently completed a coding course with <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>, 
  and I absolutely loved it! The hands-on approach and the supportive community really helped me grasp the concepts quickly. 
  Highly recommend!
</li>

<li class="list-bio"><strong>Writing pitches</strong>: Let's talk about work vibes! One thing that gets me all jazzed up is writing killer pitches. 
  It's like the highlight of my workday. I get to mix creativity with strategy, and it's a blast! Turning ideas 
  into pitches that pop? Sign me up for more of that!</li>

<li class="list-bio"><strong>Cooking vietnamese dishes</strong>: In the tranquil moments of my downtime, you'll often find me in the heart of my kitchen, 
  surrounded by the enticing aromas of Vietnamese cuisine. Cooking has become a therapeutic outlet for me. I don't know how to cook 
  until I went to study abroad. That's why I always have to find online recipes for the Vietnamese dishes. If you want to try to cook some
  Vietnamese food too, try out <a href="https://www.hungryhuy.com/" target="_blank">HungryHuy blog</a>. He has the best recipes for these dishes. </li>
